# AV Switch Control Board

A control board for operating several AV switches at once when selecting
several devices.

## Synopsis

The main goal of this project is to help retro console gamers using older
professional matrix audio/video switch, such as Extron's Crosspoint series, and
professional monitors, such as Sony's PVM and BVM series, better select the
channels to which they have connected consoles.

## Installation

Though this is designed for Raspian out of the box, it still requires one
additional library.  You can install it by running
`sudo apt install python3-pil.imagetk`

## Usage and Configuration

See the [Wiki on GitHub](http://www.github.com/6XGate/PiAvSwitchController/wiki)
for information on setting up, configuring, and using PiAvSwitchController.

## Plans

- More drivers, specifically for profession monitors like Sony PVM and BVM
  series.
- Stream or location aware configuration handling for better error reporting.
