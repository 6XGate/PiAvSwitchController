# AV Switch Control Board

A control board for operating several AV switches at once when selecting several devices.

## Synopsis

The main goal of this project is to help retro console gamers using older professional matrix audio/video switch, such as Extron's Crosspoint series, and professional monitors, such as Sony's PVM and BVM series, better select the channels to which they have connected consoles.

## Installation

Installation is pretty straightforward, read the [Wiki on GitHub](https://www.github.com/6XGate/PiAvSwitchController/wiki) for complete instructions.

## Usage and Configuration

See the [Wiki on GitHub](https://www.github.com/6XGate/PiAvSwitchController/wiki) for information on setting up, configuring, and using PiAvSwitchController.

## Plans

- Move the configuration file to an XDG standard location.
- Stream or location aware configuration handling for better error reporting.
- More drivers, which will likely be on-going.
